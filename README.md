## Introduction

This project explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education using **GPT Mobile**, an open-source Android application. We aim to investigate how AI-powered chat assistants can be used to enhance learning experiences and support educational activities. This is a research project for educational purposes and is not intended as a fully functional application for production use.

## Key Areas of Investigation

This project focuses on the following aspects of AI in education, utilizing GPT Mobile as a study tool:

*   **Personalized Learning:** How can AI adapt to individual student needs?
*   **Interactive Learning Experiences:** How can chat assistants make learning more engaging?
*   **Teacher Support:** How can AI assist teachers in lesson planning and assessment?
*   **Accessibility in Education:** Can AI provide learning opportunities to all students?
*   **Ethical Considerations:** What are the potential ethical issues associated with AI in education?

## Features (as they relate to education)

*   **Multiple AI Model Access:** Explore different AI models (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini) and compare their educational applications.
*   **Customizable Prompts:** Experiment with prompts to tailor learning experiences for various educational needs.
*   **Local Chat History:** Track and analyze interaction patterns for learning purposes (note that data is stored only locally and will not be shared).
*   **Material You Design:** Demonstrate how a modern UI can enhance user experience in educational apps.
*   **Built with Kotlin:** Show how modern Android development techniques can be used to develop educational tools.

## Usage Scenarios in Education

This project can be used in the following educational scenarios:

*   **Personal Tutor:** Students can use AI to ask questions, clarify concepts, and receive feedback.
*   **Learning Companion:** AI can be used as a tool to explore subjects, summarize information, and learn new skills.
*   **Lesson Planning Tool:** Educators can experiment with using AI to generate lesson plans, quizzes, and assignments.
*   **Accessibility Tool:** AI can be used to provide translation, text-to-speech, and other accessibility features for students with diverse needs.
